Models vs Accuracy contrast for Cifar-10 image dataset using Convolution Neural networks
The purpose of this project was to shed a light on the constraints in designing a model in CNN that yields best possible efficiency based upon factors like number of epochs, activation functions and number of Convolutional layers etc.
